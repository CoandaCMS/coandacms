## Coanda CMS

**Work in progress** I would strongly advise not using this!

Coanda is (going to be) a CMS based on the superb [Laravel framework](http://laravel.com)

I've worked with many different CMS platforms over the last decade or so and feel it is time to try and create my own.

Over the next few weeks I hope to get the basics in place.
